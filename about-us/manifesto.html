<h2 id="we_believe_that_simple_can_be_powerful">We believe that simple can be powerful.</h2>

<p>Donor Tools is not like XYZ Software Corp. We eschew the commonly accepted “must-have” feature set, offering simplicity and an alternative workflow.</p>

<h2 id="we_believe_that_donor_management_software_should_be_affordable">We believe that donor management software should be affordable.</h2>

<p>Our Starter version is robust enough for many of the smallest non-profits. That means that if you’re just starting out, you can use Donor Tools with all its features for as long as you need it. And, when you’re ready to upgrade, you’ll find the options affordable and accessible.</p>

<h2 id="we_believe_donor_management_software_should_help_you_get_to_know_your_donors_better">We believe donor management software should help you get to know your donors better.</h2>

<p>Our goal is to provide accessible, powerful tools that are a pleasure to use. We think that if you enjoy using the software, you’ll get more value out of it. If you’re like us, once you get your donor records into Donor Tools, you’ll spend time just looking at your records in ways that you haven’t tried before. Poke around your database… add some tags… look up information about a donor… record notes from conversations….</p>

<h2 id="we_believe_that_you_should_not_have_to_pay_extra_for_multiple_users">We believe that you should not have to pay extra for multiple users.</h2>

<p>You can add as many users as you need, with no additional cost.</p>

<h2 id="we_believe_that_you_should_not_have_to_pay_based_on_the_number_of_donors_you_have">We believe that you should not have to pay based on the number of donors you have.</h2>

<p>The number of names in your database is not the best indicator of your organization’s size and activity. Whether you have 50 donors or 50,000, you can bring in all your donors at no extra cost.</p>

<h2 id="we_believe_that_donor_management_software_should_be_online">We believe that donor management software should be online.</h2>

<p>We don’t like installing software. With Donor Tools, there’s nothing to install - just fire up your web browser and you’re ready to go.</p>

<h2 id="we_believe_you_should_get_free_upgrades">We believe you should get free upgrades.</h2>

<p>With Donor Tools, you don’t have to pay for upgrades, ever. Because it’s online, you’ll always be running the latest version of the software. Donor Tools has been designed from the ground up using the latest techniques and technologies for web-based software.</p>

<h2 id="we_believe_that_you_shouldnt_have_to_jump_through_hoops_to_try_us_out">We believe that you shouldn’t have to jump through hoops to try us out.</h2>

<p>You don’t have to talk to a salesperson to try Donor Tools. Just sign up whenever is convenient for you, and start your two-week free trial. Upgrade or downgrade any time, without asking permission or having to talk to a salesperson. If you decide to cancel or downgrade after your free trial, we will not charge you anything.</p>

<p>Upgrade, downgrade, or cancel at any time without penalty. There are no cancellation fees, so you can feel confident that you won’t be locked into any kind of usage contract.</p>

<h2 id="we_believe_you_can_start_small">We believe you can start small.</h2>

<p>You don’t have to be an “official” non-profit organization to use Donor Tools. Anyone can use Donor Tools to keep track of donations. Going on a mission trip? No problem. Raising money for a political campaign? Got you covered. Starting a non-profit but don’t have your tax id yet? Come on in. Not based in the United States? No problem. Whether you’re an individual or group raising money for a pet project or an established non-profit charity, Donor Tools can help you keep track of donations and understand your donors.</p>

<h2 id="donor_tools_is_not_fundraising_software">Donor Tools is not fundraising software.</h2>

<p>Although it is designed to help support your fundraising efforts. At its core, Donor Tools is designed to help you get to know your donors better.</p>

<h2 id="we_believe_in_ubiquitous_reporting">We believe in ubiquitous reporting</h2>

<p>Powerful reporting features don’t have to be complicated or expensive. Every page on Donor Tools is designed to tell you something useful. Every page prints out with beautiful, clear formatting designed especially for printing.</p>

<p>We uses Tags and Smart Tags to put powerful reporting into your hands. Tags give you the ability to group donors and donations together in any way that makes sense to you. Smart Tags change with your database, applying themselves where needed.</p>

<h2 id="we_believe_you_can_take_it_with_you">We believe you can take it with you.</h2>

<p>Export and back up your data in most common formats, including CSV (for Microsoft Excel) and QuickBooks.</p>
